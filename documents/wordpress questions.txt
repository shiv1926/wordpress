how to create common functions for all themes in wordpress

===========================================================================
what are hooks, how many types of hooks are available ?
They enable plugin developers to “hook” into the WordPress workflow to change how it works without directly modifying the core code.
WordPress has two primary types of hooks: action hooks and filter hooks. 
The former enables you to execute a function at a certain point, and the latter enables you to manipulate the output passed through the hook.

good tips : 
stop using query_posts(). See the codex about this function to see why you shouldn't use it in themes or plugins. Anyway, if you are in a some weird situation where you have not option and you need to use query_posts(), you should run wp_reset_query() after the loop. You must know that you are using the global $wp_query, that contains the original query made by WordPress, and then query_post that alter the global $wp_query variable, you end up with unexpected results. Additionally, you are using a deprecated parameter showposts, replaced by posts_per_page.
