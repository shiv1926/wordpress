The WordPress REST API provides access to WordPress data using HTTP endpoints. This makes it easy for developers to interact with sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON objects.

As of WordPress Rest API v2, there are many endpoints available to work with posts, pages, users, categories, media, comments, and other settings. Unfortunately, there is no endpoint to get Menu Items. However, you can create custom endpoints to extend WordPress Rest API.
